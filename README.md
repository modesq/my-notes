## hello there,
**my name is mahmoud qunbor**

_I am studying software engineering in ASAC_

> "i love music and experiencing audiophile headphones, my goal is to build my own collection of headphones"

i plan on starting with both:
1. [audio technica m50x](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86)

2. [beyerdynamics DT 770 pro](https://www.amazon.com/beyerdynamic-770-PRO-Studio-Headphone/dp/B0006NL5SM)

understanding the purpose of the software is a major factor in writing good code, it will also make the goal of said software clearer.

Not understanding the goal and the purpose of the software can cause unnecessary complexity, to mitigate that; creating simpler code should be the goal of every developer. all of that combined will result in code that is easy maintain and upkeep, alongside that consistency should be thought of from the start to make all the previous points easier to do.
